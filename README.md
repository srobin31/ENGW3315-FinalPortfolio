# README: An Interdisciplinary Exploration Through Writing

## Prologue
This project is the culmination of a semester's worth of work in Advanced Writing. Consisting of 4 pieces of writing alongside short intros for context, this portfolio along with a final reflection is meant to be a showcase of my writing. In brainstorming ideas for this portfolio, I thought word clouds would be a super cool way to visualize my work. One of my homeworks for a data science class this semester was textual analysis of six poems read at presidential inuagurations. For the assignment, one task involved making word clouds. I feel like a lot of my writing for this class revolved around two main subjects: computer science and reflection. I thought this visualization would help provide insight into whether or not this was really the case. As such, I've included the visualization as a preview into some of the themes you can expect while reading. Enjoy!
