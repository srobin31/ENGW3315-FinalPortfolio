#### **Extra Visual: Word Clouds**
In brainstorming ideas for this portfolio, I thought word clouds would be a super cool way to visualize my work. One of my homeworks for my data science class this semester was textual analysis of six poems read at presidential inuagurations. For the assignment, one task involved making word clouds. I feel like a lot of my writing for this class revolved around two main subjects: computer science and reflection. I thought this visualization would help provide insight into whether or not this was really the case.
