# README: A Self-Reflective Interdisciplinary Exploration of Computer Science

### ENGW 3315: Interdisciplinary Advanced Writing in the Disciplines
---
## Introduction
This project is the culmination of a semester's worth of work in Advanced Writing. Consisting of 4 pieces of writing alongside short intros for context, this—along with a final reflection—is meant to be a showcase of my writing. In brainstorming ideas for this portfolio, I thought word clouds would be a super cool way to visualize my work. One of my homeworks for a data science class this semester was textual analysis of six poems read at presidential inuagurations. For the assignment, one task involved making word clouds. I feel like a lot of my writing for this class revolved around two main subjects: computer science and reflection. I thought this visualization would help provide insight into whether or not this was really the case. As such, I've included the visualization as a preview into some of the themes you can expect while reading. Enjoy!

## Artifact 1
*Week 4: February 10*  
This first piece is a letter to the rest of my Advanced Writing section detailing my reaction to sections 1 and 2 of [A Time for Interdisciplinarity](a_time_for_interdisciplinarity.pdf) before sharing how my discipline of computer science is interdisciplinary. Of course, the topic of how computer science overlaps with other disciplines could be written about much more extensively, but I chose to focus on some of my personal experiences, moving from my major of computer science to my mathematics minor to a data science class I was taking at the time of writing.

## Artifact 2
*Week 6: February 24*  
This piece—made two weeks after the previous—is a direct follow-up; it is exactly what the title might suggest: my discipline of computer science made visual. In the last piece, I acknowledged the many combined majors within the Khoury College of Computer Sciences. It was instead of briefly writing to the interdisciplinary nature of these majors that I chose to focus on personal experiences. However, for this visual piece, I created a graphic showing all the possible combined majors, color-coded by college. After posting this visual, someone shared the idea of sizing the bubbles based on how many people are enrolled in each major which I think is a great idea, but this information was unfortunately not available.

## Artifact 3
*Week 5: February 19*  
This piece actually came as a reflection post in between the two previous. With the prompt focused on the idea of "unlearning to learn", I leaned on my computer science experiences yet again. I close out this piece by writing about a plan to share my story of how I first learned how to code—which is very different than the way the introductory classes at Northeastern are taught. I never did do this piece of extra writing, but I'll speak a little more to that in my closing remarks.

## Artifact 4
*Week 8: March 10*  
Coming after a lovely week's break from writing, this piece is a self-assessment of my work in this class up until this point as well as some personal thoughts on the [grading contract](grading_contract.pdf) used for this class in the form of a Q&A.

## Final Reflection
*Final Weeks: April 21*  
For perhaps the first time in my life, I am settling for what will most likely not be an A. Not to say that this won’t be my first non-A, but rather, at some point I became content with the idea that I will not receive an A for this course. The grading contract was there from the start; I knew what I had to do. When it came time to do it though, I rationalized that the extra writing just wasn’t worth it for me. As I wrote in my Midpoint Reflection, “I dread writing.” Week in and week out, the writing assignments would sneak up on me, and I’d just be miserable thinking about having to write. While I couldn’t find it exactly, I believe I remember reading that posting various extra pieces during the last week of class was less than ideal. Knowing this, and myself in that I most certainly would not want to be writing piece after piece at the end of the semester, I thought I could and would space them out. In closing out my week 5 post about unlearning to learn, I thought I’d put it in writing that I planned to write an extra about how I first learned how to code. I never wrote that extra piece. In closing out my week 8 reflective self-assessment, I wrote, “I do very much intend on writing more as we close out the second half of this class.” I did that marginally, if at all. I believe at the end of the day, it boils down to the simple fact that I have zero intrinsic motivation to write, and for the case of this course, that intrinsic motivation sadly outweighed any extrinsic motivation for an A. 

I think my biggest takeaway from this class will be its interdisciplinary nature. From the way it was infused into the writing prompts to the various learning I did through reading the writing of students in other disciplines, the interdisciplinarity of this class lived up to its name. However, as much as I did enjoy this aspect of the course, I can’t help but wonder how I would have fared in ENGW 3302 Advanced Writing in the Technical Professions. As it is, a lot of my writing did touch on computer science, but I doubt the prompts would’ve enabled an entire class to speak on the same matters and experiences. Overall, I am happy enough with how this class went and my role within it. I wouldn’t say I surprised myself, but it was interesting to see where I drew the line in pursuit of an A. I thought my initial peer interactions were helpful and insightful, but I often failed to respond to my peers’ interactions and questions on my own posts—another example of my inability to go above and beyond that which was asked of me. However, I am satisfied to say that I am proud of all the work that I did put out. Whether it was research about diversity initiatives Khoury college is taking, offering an honest opinion on the grading contract, or making visualizations to accompany my writing, I can say that once I did find the motivation to write, I wrote to my satisfaction, even if a post or two was late because of my delayed motivation. Among a curriculum of computer science and math classes that in ways all blend together, this course will stand out as being different, joining the likes of Public Speaking and Jazz. In closing, I can happily say that I have no regrets with regards to the advanced writing class that I took, when I took it, and the work that I put into it.
