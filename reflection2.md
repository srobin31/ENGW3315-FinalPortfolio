### Reflection (2)
---

As I have for almost every one of my discussion board posts, I will be writing to my experiences of unlearning to learn as it relates to my background as a programmer. The first thing that comes to mind is how different learning how to code can be compared to a typical classroom learning experience, especially in middle and high school. I first started programming in my freshman year of high school. Up until then, I think it's a fairly common mentality to not just go to Google for questions or solutions. Whether it's answering questions based directly on textbook readings, math problems that can be reasoned out, or memorized formulas, Google was not the go-to platform coming out of grade school that it is now. Google Search, and more specifically StackOverflow, is a programmer's best friend. Such behavior of Googling any and all questions is also completely expected in the work place.


Another instance of unlearning to learn was Fundies I, or the introductory Computer Science class at Northeastern, Fundamentals of Computer Science I. Unlike many schools, AP Computer Science does not excuse students from this first class, there is no way of testing out of it, and it uses a subset of the programming language Racket. I certainly have my gripes with Fundies I, but it's hard to say how much of these are a result of the class being very different from the way I first learned how to code using Python. However, the class is not even designed to teach Racket or even how to program; rather, the goal of the class is to teach students how to think like a computer scientist. Because of this more abstract concept, the approach to the class was certainly a new one for me, and did require some unlearning. I won't go too deep into specifics, but Racket is a functional programming language and quite different from object-oriented languages that me and most other people start with. Another key aspect of Fundies I is that the entire class is done via pair programming. Given that most people are not familiar with this new language, most everyone is on an equal playing field which helps to encourage this pair programming. For those unfamiliar, the rough idea behind pair programming is that one partner is the pilot, doing all the typing, and the other is the co-pilot, guiding the pilot with a plan of what to type. While it has some merits, I find it mostly not worth it, and fairly unrealistic with respect to most companies. 


However, Fundies I has truly come full circle for me this semester. While it's not exactly in the best or worst way, I am doing my fair share of relearning. For context, I am taking Programming Languages (PL) and Software Development. Like Fundies I, PL's aim is to teach the abstract: to understand the underlying principles of programming languages such that I am comfortable with learning new programming languages, even those that have not yet been invented. And go figure, the best way to do this is with Racketâ€”the actual language this time (as compared to the subset of Fundies I). Software development on the other hand is entirely pair programming. The class consists of just a few lectures, followed by panel-based code reviews for the rest of the semester. After the struggle to coordinate schedules, there's the expectation that all code is written in total conjunction; while this probably sounds reasonable, I believe it to be relatively inefficient and for the most part unrealistic post-grad. Of course working among a team is a thing everywhere, but with documented code and a team you can trust, the pilot, co-pilot system is not something I love. One thing that I've found funny this semester is the reaction of all my friends who have taken Fundies I anytime I tell them I'm back to using Racket or that so much of my work is pair programming. Often times its disbelief that Racket would make a reoccurrence in life or remembering the struggle of having to work so closely with a partner.


In closing, I hope this discussion board post didn't come across as simply sharing my gripes with Northeastern's computer science curriculum. Rather, it is Fundies I that has probably been the biggest instance of me having to unlearn to learn. This isn't my first time talking about my problems with Fundies I, and at some point I would like to share to the extra discussion boards my experience of learning computer science and how to code.
